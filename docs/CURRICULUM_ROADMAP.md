# KidsLearnAI

## 2-Year Curriculum Roadmap

_Empowering the Next Generation with AI Education_

**Ages 9-13 | 12 Levels | Join Anytime**

December 2024

---

## Program Overview

The KidsLearnAI 2-Year Program is designed to take students from complete beginners to confident AI practitioners. Our curriculum builds progressively, with each level expanding on skills learned in previous levels. Students who complete the full program will have a comprehensive understanding of programming, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

### Program Structure

- **Total Journey:** 12 levels across approximately 2 years
- **Class Schedule:** Weekly 60-minute live sessions, year-round
- **Enrollment:** Join anytime — no waiting for "start dates"
- **Class Size:** Maximum 15 students for personalized attention
- **Advancement:** Skill-based progression — move up when you're ready

### How It Works

Unlike traditional courses with fixed start dates, KidsLearnAI runs continuously throughout the year. Each level class runs weekly, and students progress to the next level when they've demonstrated mastery — not on a fixed schedule.

**Example:**

- Your child joins Level 1 on February 15
- They attend Level 1 classes weekly for 8-12 weeks
- When they complete the Level 1 project and show mastery, they advance to Level 2
- No waiting, no "next term starts in March" — just continuous learning

### The Learning Journey

**Year 1: Foundations (Levels 1-6)** — Students master Python programming fundamentals and are introduced to AI concepts, data analysis, and basic machine learning.

**Year 2: Applied AI (Levels 7-12)** — Students apply their knowledge to build real AI projects including chatbots, image classifiers, recommendation systems, and game AI.

**Year 3+: Specialization** — Advanced students choose specialty tracks in robotics, web development, mobile apps, data science, or AI research.

### Certificates & Milestones

## How Enrollment Works

### Join Anytime

Unlike traditional courses with fixed start dates, KidsLearnAI runs year-round. New students can join any week — no waiting for the "next session" to begin.

### Skill-Based Placement

New students complete a brief assessment to determine the appropriate starting level:

- **Complete beginners:** Start at Level 1
- **Some coding experience:** May start at Level 2 or 3
- **Prior Python experience:** Placement based on demonstrated skills

### Flexible Progression

Students advance when they're ready, not on a fixed schedule:

- **Typical pace:** 8-10 weeks per level (~2 years for full program)
- **Faster learners:** Can advance sooner if they demonstrate mastery
- **Need more time:** Can take extra weeks without penalty or stigma

### Weekly Class Schedule

Each level runs as a separate weekly class:

| Level    | Day              | Time     | Focus                |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| Level 1  | Saturday         | 10:00 AM | Python Basics        |
| Level 2  | Saturday         | 11:30 AM | Loops & Iteration    |
| Level 3  | Saturday         | 1:00 PM  | Functions & Data     |
| Level 4+ | Weekday evenings | Various  | AI & Advanced Topics |

_Schedule may vary based on enrollment. Multiple sections available for popular levels._

### What Happens When You Advance

When your child is ready for the next level:

1. Instructor confirms mastery through project completion and assessment
2. You receive advancement notification with new class schedule
3. Child joins the next level class the following week
4. No waiting, no gaps — continuous learning

### Missed a Class?

Life happens! If your child misses a class:

- All sessions are recorded and available within 24 hours
- Watch the replay before the next class
- Extra help sessions available if needed
- No penalty for occasional absences
