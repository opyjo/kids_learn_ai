# Your Child's AI Journey

## A 2-Year Program to Prepare Your Child for the Future

_From complete beginner to confident AI practitioner_

## Why AI Education Matters Now

Artificial intelligence is transforming every industry—from healthcare to entertainment, transportation to education. By the time your child enters the workforce, AI skills won't just be valuable—they'll be essential.

Yet most schools don't offer AI education. The few programs that exist are either too expensive for average families or rely on self-paced videos that leave kids disengaged.

**KidsLearnAI is different.** We provide live, interactive instruction that makes AI accessible, engaging, and fun for children ages 9-13.

## The 2-Year Journey

Our program is designed like a learning journey, not a single course. Just like learning a musical instrument or a sport, AI skills develop over time with consistent practice and progressive challenges.

| Phase                        | What Your Child Learns                                                                                                      | What They Can Build                                                                                       |

## Why a 2-Year Program?

Learning AI isn't like taking a single course—it's like learning a musical instrument. Your child needs time to:

- **Build strong foundations:** Python programming skills take time to develop properly. Rushing creates gaps that hold kids back later.

- **Practice and reinforce:** Each term builds on previous learning. Concepts that seem hard in Term 2 become second nature by Term 5.

- **Build real projects:** By Year 2, your child builds genuinely impressive AI projects—not toy examples, but working chatbots, image classifiers, and game AI.

- **Develop confidence:** Long-term learning builds deep confidence. Your child won't just know about AI—they'll be comfortable creating with it.

### Think of It Like Kumon for AI

You wouldn't expect your child to master math in 8 weeks. Programs like Kumon and Mathnasium work because they provide consistent, progressive instruction over time. Our AI program works the same way—steady progress with visible milestones along the journey.

## How It Works

### Term Structure

- **8-week terms:** Each term is 8 weeks of live instruction
- **6 terms per year:** With breaks between terms for rest and catch-up
- **60-minute sessions:** One live class per week, plus practice time
- **Small classes:** Maximum 15 students ensures personal attention

### Progress Tracking

You'll always know how your child is progressing:

- Term-end progress reports with skill assessments
- Certificates at key milestones (Python Foundations, AI Explorer, Graduate Diploma)
- Project showcases where your child presents their work
- Portfolio of completed projects to share with family and schools

### Flexible Enrollment

- **Start anytime:** New beginner cohorts start every 8 weeks
- **Skill-based placement:** Kids with coding experience can start at an appropriate level
- **Flexible pacing:** Students advance when ready, not on a fixed schedule
- **Catch-up support:** Missed a class? Recordings and extra help are available

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does my child need any prior experience?**

No! Our program is designed for complete beginners. We start from scratch and build progressively. Kids with some coding experience can take a placement assessment to start at an appropriate level.

**What if my child misses a class?**

All sessions are recorded. Your child can watch the replay and catch up before the next class. We also offer extra help sessions for students who need additional support.

**What if my child isn't ready to advance?**

Every child learns at their own pace. Students can repeat a term if needed—there's no shame in taking extra time to master concepts. Strong foundations are more important than speed.

**Can my child join mid-year?**

Yes! We start new beginner cohorts (Term 1) every 8 weeks. Your child can also take a placement assessment if they have prior coding experience and join an appropriate level.

**What equipment does my child need?**

A computer (Windows, Mac, or Chromebook) with reliable internet and a webcam. We provide all software and learning materials—no additional purchases required.

**Do I have to commit to 2 years upfront?**
s
No! You enroll term-by-term. We recommend the full 2-year journey for maximum benefit, but you're not locked in. Most families choose to continue because they see their child's progress and enthusiasm.
