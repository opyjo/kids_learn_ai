          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Kids Learn AI was born after watching brilliant young minds feel
            intimidated by code‚Äîor worse, convinced technology wasn&apos;t ‚Äúfor
            them.‚Äù We knew that if kids could see Python as playful, and if they
            could explore AI in a safe, transparent way, they would realise the
            future was theirs to shape.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">
            So we gathered educators, engineers, parents, and students to design
            a learning path that respects curiosity, embraces culture, and meets
            families exactly where they are. The result is a platform that feels
            like a friend cheering you on, backed by curriculum rigour and
            real-world relevance.

                AI already shapes the stories our kids watch, the music they
                stream, and the news they read. Understanding how algorithms
                decide things builds healthy skepticism and critical thinking.
              </li>
              <li>
                Learning Python first gives children the mental models they need
                to stay curious and in control when they encounter AI systems.
                They see behind the curtain and learn to ask better questions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Early exposure is protective. Kids learn about bias, privacy,
                and consent before they adopt harmful habits or internalise the
                idea that technology is neutral.
              </li>
              <li>
                The earlier we nurture confidence, the more diverse voices we
                welcome into advanced courses, internships, and careers.
